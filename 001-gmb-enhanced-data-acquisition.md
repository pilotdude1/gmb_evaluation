# 001-gmb-enhanced-data-acquisition

## What We're Building
Enhance the existing Google My Business evaluation system to become an intelligent, automated customer acquisition engine that leverages AI for lead qualification and integrates with external automation tools.

## Current State (Preserve & Enhance)

### Existing Successful Components
- **CRM Accounts Table**: Already captures GMB data including `gmb_place_id`, `gmb_rating`, `gmb_review_count`, `gmb_data` JSON field
- **Lead Scoring**: Current `lead_score` field in both `crm_accounts` and `crm_contacts` tables
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Proper tenant isolation with `tenant_id` fields and RLS policies
- **Search Functionality**: Existing `search_vector` fields for full-text search
- **Activity Tracking**: Comprehensive `crm_activities` system for interaction logging
- **Authentication**: Robust Supabase auth with enhanced security validation

### Current Workflow (To Be Enhanced)
1. GMB data collection (manual or basic automation)
2. Storage in `crm_accounts.gmb_data` field
3. Basic lead scoring algorithm
4. Manual review and qualification in CRM interface

## Enhancement Goals

### 1. AI-Powered Lead Qualification
**Current**: Basic lead scoring algorithm  
**Enhanced**: AI-driven qualification using business signals, review sentiment, competitive analysis

**Success Criteria**:
- Achieve 85%+ accuracy in identifying qualified prospects
- Reduce manual review time by 70%
- Automatically categorize prospects by service business type (healthcare, trades, professional services)

### 2. Automated Data Enrichment
**Current**: GMB data only  
**Enhanced**: Multi-source data collection including email discovery, company size, technology stack signals

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ data completion rate for qualified prospects
- Email discovery success rate of 75%+
- Integration with Anymail Finder, Clearbit, and other enrichment services

### 3. External Tool Integration
**Current**: Standalone CRM system  
**Enhanced**: Seamless integration with n8n, Make.com, ClickUp, and Apify

**Success Criteria**:
- Automated workflow triggers between systems
- Real-time sync of qualified prospects to ClickUp
- n8n/Make.com workflows for follow-up automation

### 4. Industry-Specific Optimization
**Current**: Generic business data collection  
**Enhanced**: Tailored data collection and scoring for target industries

**Success Criteria**:
- Industry-specific qualification criteria
- Customized data fields for healthcare, trades, professional services
- Automated classification of business types

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Service Business Owners
**As a dental practice owner**, I want qualified local prospects with good GMB presence automatically added to my ClickUp pipeline so I can focus on patient care instead of lead research.

**As an HVAC contractor**, I need to identify homeowners and businesses with aging systems or maintenance needs before my competitors contact them.

**As a business consultant**, I want to find companies showing growth signals (new locations, positive reviews, increased activity) that indicate they need my services.

### Secondary Users: Marketing Agencies
**As a marketing agency**, I want to automatically identify potential clients based on their GMB review patterns, response rates, and competitive positioning.
