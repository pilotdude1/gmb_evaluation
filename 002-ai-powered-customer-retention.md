## What We're Building
Transform the existing CRM campaign and activity tracking system into an intelligent customer retention platform that predicts churn, automates engagement campaigns, and maximizes customer lifetime value for service businesses.

## Current State (Preserve & Enhance)

### Existing Successful Components
- **Campaign Management**: Full `crm_campaigns` table with email/SMS tracking and membership management

- **Deal Pipeline**: `crm_deals` system for revenue tracking and probability management
- **Notification System**: Built-in notification framework for user alerts

### Current Workflow (To Be Enhanced)
1. Manual campaign creation and management
2. Basic activity logging when contacts interact
3. Manual deal stage progression
4. Simple email/SMS metrics tracking
5. Reactive approach to customer issues

- Automatically trigger retention campaigns for at-risk customers

### 2. Intelligent Campaign Automation
**Current**: Manual campaign creation and management  
**Enhanced**: AI-driven campaign optimization with behavioral triggers

**Success Criteria**:

**As an HVAC contractor**, I want automated reminders for maintenance contracts and seasonal service offerings to increase recurring revenue from existing customers.

**As a business consultant**, I want to track client satisfaction throughout projects and automatically trigger follow-up campaigns for additional services or referrals.

### Marketing Teams
**As a marketing manager**, I want AI to determine the optimal time and channel to reach each customer for maximum engagement.

**As a campaign manager**, I want automated A/B testing of retention messages to continuously improve our approach.
