# CRM System Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Congratulations! Your CRM database schema is ready!

Your Supabase Cloud database now has all the CRM tables and is ready to connect to your SvelteKit application.

## 📋 Environment Setup

### 1. Create your environment file

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration for CRM
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gcgejeliljokhkuvpsxf.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Optional: Service role key (for admin operations)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 2. Get your Supabase credentials

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gcgejeliljokhkuvpsxf
2. **Navigate to Settings → API**
3. **Copy the following:**
   - **Project URL** → Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public key** → Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role secret key** → Use for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional, for admin operations)

## 🚀 What's Been Created

### Database Schema (✅ Applied to Supabase Cloud)

- **16 tables** for complete CRM functionality
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with proper isolation
- **Row Level Security** policies for data protection
- **Audit logging** for change tracking
- **Performance indexes** for fast queries

### SvelteKit Application Components

#### 1. CRM Client (`src/lib/crm/crmClient.ts`)

- Type-safe client for all CRM operations
- Methods for accounts, contacts, deals, activities
- Dashboard statistics
- Error handling and validation

#### 2. CRM Layout (`src/routes/crm/+layout.svelte`)

- Navigation for CRM sections
- Authentication guards
- Responsive design

#### 3. CRM Dashboard (`src/routes/crm/+page.svelte`)

- Overview statistics
- Quick actions
- Activity breakdown

#### 4. Accounts Management (`src/routes/crm/accounts/+page.svelte`)

- List all accounts
- Search and filtering
- Pagination
- Business type categorization

#### 5. TypeScript Types (`src/lib/database.types.ts`)

- Generated from your database schema
- Type safety for all CRM operations

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Start your development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Visit your CRM system

Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/crm

### 3. Test the connection

- The dashboard should load and show statistics (likely 0 for empty database)
- Try adding a new account via the "Add Account" button

### 4. Create additional pages (optional)

You can extend the system by creating:

- `/crm/contacts/+page.svelte` - Contacts listing
- `/crm/deals/+page.svelte` - Deals pipeline
- `/crm/activities/+page.svelte` - Activity timeline
- Form pages for creating/editing records

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Row Level Security** - Users can only see their tenant's data
- **Authentication required** - All CRM routes require login
- **Type safety** - TypeScript prevents data corruption
- **Input validation** - Client-side and database constraints
